# Claude Code Instructions

## Commit Discipline

Use Conventional Commits with these prefixes:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes  
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `test:` - Test additions/modifications
- `docs:` - Documentation changes

### Commit Strategy
- First commit should be: `feat: scaffold project skeleton`
- Subsequent commits should follow one logical change per commit principle
- Each section of work should be committed separately for clear history
